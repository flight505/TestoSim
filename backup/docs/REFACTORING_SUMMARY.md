# TestoSim Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed to refactor TestoSim from using legacy models (InjectionProtocol and Cycle) to a unified Treatment model. The refactoring simplifies the architecture, improves code organization, and enhances maintainability.

## Completed Work

### Architecture Updates

- **Unified Treatment Model**: Implemented a comprehensive model that handles both simple and advanced treatments
- **VisualizationModel Enhancements**: Created a multi-layered visualization system with effect indices
- **CoreData Integration**: Updated persistence layer with improved relationships
- **Data Migration**: Implemented bidirectional conversion between legacy and new models

### Code Improvements

- **Removed Deprecated Methods**: Eliminated legacy bridge methods in AppDataStore
- **Simplified AppDataStore**: Refactored to leverage TreatmentViewModel
- **Clean Simulation Logic**: Consolidated redundant simulation methods
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Implemented comprehensive visualization capabilities

### UI Enhancements

- **TreatmentFormView**: Updated form for creating and editing treatments
- **TreatmentDetailView**: Enhanced detail view with better visualization
- **AdvancedTreatmentView**: Created a specialized view for advanced treatments
- **AddBloodworkView**: Updated to work with the unified model

### Documentation

- **README Updates**: Updated with information on the unified model architecture
- **Migration Plan**: Created a detailed plan for transitioning from legacy to unified models
- **Next Steps**: Documented final steps to complete the migration
- **Rename Script**: Created a script to facilitate file replacements

## Files Created/Updated

| Purpose | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Core Data Manager | `CoreDataManager_Updated.swift` | ✅ |
| App Data Store | `AppDataStore_Refactored.swift` | ✅ |
| Main View | `ContentView_Updated.swift` | ✅ |
| Form View | `TreatmentFormView_Updated.swift` | ✅ |
| Detail View | `TreatmentDetailView_Updated.swift` | ✅ |
| Advanced Treatment View | `AdvancedTreatmentView.swift` | ✅ |
| Bloodwork View | `AddBloodworkView_Updated.swift` | ✅ |
| Migration Plan | `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` | ✅ |
| Next Steps | `NEXT_STEPS.md` | ✅ |
| Rename Script | `rename-updated-files.sh` | ✅ |

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single model for all treatment types reduces complexity
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns in the codebase
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Consistent UI approach for different treatment types
4. **Future-Proof Design**: More flexible model allows for future enhancements
5. **Performance Optimization**: Streamlined code with fewer redundant operations

## Next Steps

To complete the migration:

1. Run the rename script: `./rename-updated-files.sh`
2. Update imports in affected files
3. Remove legacy model files
4. Update tests to use the unified model
5. Conduct thorough testing of all functionality

See `NEXT_STEPS.md` for detailed instructions on completing the migration.

## Conclusion

The refactoring provides a solid foundation for future development. The unified Treatment model simplifies the codebase while enhancing functionality. By following the provided migration plan, the transition from legacy to unified models can be completed smoothly.
