# TestoSim App - Compilation Error Fix

## Issue Identified
Your app is experiencing compilation issues because **the Swift files are not included in the main application target**. This is why you're seeing "Cannot find type" errors for nearly all your custom types.

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Add Files to Target
1. Open the TestoSim project in Xcode (which is already done)
2. In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), select all the following Swift files:
   ```
   ./TestoSim/ContentView.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/BloodworkModel.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/Compound.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/CompoundLibrary.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/DataPoint.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/EsterData.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/PKModel.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/ProfileModel.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/ProtocolModel.swift
   ./TestoSim/Models/VialBlend.swift
   ./TestoSim/TestoSimApp.swift
   ./TestoSim/ViewModels/AppDataStore.swift
   ./TestoSim/Views/AddBloodworkView.swift
   ./TestoSim/Views/ProfileView.swift
   ./TestoSim/Views/ProtocolDetailView.swift
   ./TestoSim/Views/ProtocolFormView.swift
   ./TestoSim/Views/ProtocolListView.swift
   ./TestoSim/Views/TestosteroneChart.swift
   ```
   
   You can use Cmd+click to select multiple files.

3. Once all files are selected, open the File Inspector (right sidebar, first tab that looks like a document)
4. Under "Target Membership", check the box next to "TestoSim" for all selected files

### Step 2: Clean and Build
1. Clean the build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder (or Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Build the project: Product → Build (or Cmd+B)

## Why This Works
Your project is using a FileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup setup, but the Swift files weren't explicitly included in the build phase. Adding them to the target membership ensures they're compiled as part of the app.

## Additional Notes
1. If you still encounter enum context errors like "Cannot infer contextual base in reference", make sure to fully qualify enum values:
   - Change `.testosterone` to `Compound.Class.testosterone`
   - Change `.intramuscular` to `Compound.Route.intramuscular`
   - Change `.cypionate` to `TestosteroneEster.cypionate`

2. For Text formatting, you're already using the modern approach with `.formatted()`. Continue using this pattern instead of the deprecated `specifier:` parameter.

3. If any file-specific issues remain after fixing target membership, we can address them individually.
