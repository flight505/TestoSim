## Code Conventions & Naming Guidelines

To avoid build errors and conflicts in the codebase, follow these naming conventions:

| Issue | Convention |
|-------|------------|
| Swift Keywords | Never use Swift reserved keywords (`protocol`, `class`, `struct`, etc.) as variable names |
| Protocol Variables | Use `treatmentProtocol` or `protocolItem` instead of `protocol` for InjectionProtocol variables |
| Struct Names | Prefix struct names with context (e.g., `InjectionAdherenceStatsView`, `NotificationAdherenceStatsView`) |
| Common Error Avoidance | When looping through protocol collections, always use: `for treatmentProtocol in protocols` or `for item in protocols` |

### Fixed Codebase Issues:
- ✅ AppDataStore.swift - Fixed `for protocol in deletedProtocols` to `for item in deletedProtocols`
- ✅ InjectionHistoryView.swift - Fixed duplicate struct `AdherenceStatsView` to `InjectionAdherenceStatsView`
- ✅ NotificationSettingsView.swift - Renamed `AdherenceStatsView` to `NotificationAdherenceStatsView`
- ✅ Protocol parameter in functions - Changed to `treatmentProtocol` where used as a parameter name

**Note**: Using Swift keywords as variable names results in compile-time errors like `expected pattern` or `expected Sequence expression`.

## Code Cleanup

As part of our ongoing refinement of the application architecture, we've made the following improvements:

1. [x] Removed redundant TestosteroneEster model
   * The legacy TestosteroneEster model has been completely removed
   * All protocols now use the more flexible Compound model
   * Protocol creation process has been simplified to just two options: Compound and Blend
   * Core Data persistence has been updated to store compound/blend references in the notes field until the data model is updated

2. [x] Simplified protocol type selection
   * Protocols now clearly identify as either compound-based or blend-based
   * UI has been streamlined to show only the relevant options for each type
   * Added proper route selection for all protocol types

3. [x] Improved database efficiency
   * Protocols now store direct references to compounds and blends instead of duplicating data
   * Added support for extended property serialization in the Core Data persistence layer
   * Prepared the application for future data model updates

These changes have resulted in a more maintainable codebase and a clearer user experience when creating and managing protocols.

4. [x] Added comprehensive notification system
   * Created NotificationManager class to handle all notification-related functionality
   * Integrated notification scheduling with protocol management
   * Added adherence tracking system to monitor user compliance
   * Created UI for managing notification preferences and viewing adherence data
